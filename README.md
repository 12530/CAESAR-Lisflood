# caesar-lisflood

This is a modified version of the Caesar-Lisflood model I use during my phd work: linking atmospheric dynamics and landscape evolution models.

This version has extra routines for bedrock erosion based on shear stress calculated directly from the hydrodynamic shallow water flow model in CAESAR-Lisflood.
